<h2 id="advantages"> Advantages</h2>

<p id="content">The advantages of being left-handed are pleantiful,
advantages such as: being unique as only ten percent of the <br>population
is left-handed, and reportedly recovering from strokes quicker as lefty's 
constantly strengthen both <br> sides of the brain. More advantages include having an upper hand in 
sports where opposing players are more <br>accustomed to right-handed opponents, 
and reportedly being able to solve complex problems more efficiently <br>by 
more readily using both sides of the brain. </p>

<h2 id="disadvantages"> Disadvantages</h2>

<p id="content2">As the advantages are pleantiful, so are disadvantages, with a small
percentage of the population being left-handed,<br> a lot of everyday objects
are made for right-handed people. Objects such as power tools, playing cards,
and most<br> school desks. Other disadvantages include handwriting, the english 
language is written and read from top to bottom,<br> and left to right; 
as a consequence, left-handed people smudge and smear what they have already written,
as if the<br> writing wasn't already unlegible.
